EMAIL BODY (copy/paste):
Honorable [Title] [Last Name],

I am writing to share a brief, Catholic-grounded civil-law analysis relevant to the Absolute Divorce Bill currently before Congress.

This material addresses civil law only and does not challenge Church doctrine on sacramental marriage. It focuses on the real-world consequences of the current legal framework for women, children, and poor families, and whether these outcomes remain consistent with human dignity, justice, and the common good.

For ease of reference, doctrine citations, national statistics, and primary sources are centralized here:

A concise two-page policy brief is also attached for quick review.

Respectfully,
[Your Name]
[City / Province]
